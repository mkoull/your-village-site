          <h1>Why Your Village exists.</h1>

          <p>I watched someone I love go through the first weeks after having a baby with no family nearby, no plan, and no idea where to start finding help. She's capable, resourceful, and organised — and none of that mattered. She was exhausted, overwhelmed, and doing something she had never done before while recovering from something her body had never done before.</p>

          <p>The help existed. Doulas, lactation consultants, meal services, sleep specialists — they were all out there, often just a few suburbs away. But finding them, vetting them, working out who was right, booking them, coordinating their schedules — all of that fell on the person who had the least capacity to do it.</p>

          <p>Your Village is the thing I wished had existed for her. A person who already knows the providers, who listens to what you're going through, and who puts the right support in place so you don't have to figure it out alone. Not an app. Not a directory. A real person who coordinates real help around your family.</p>

          <h2 class="mt-xl">How we choose providers.</h2>

          <p>Every provider in our network has been personally vetted — not just their qualifications, but how they treat families. We have a conversation with every provider before we refer a single family to them. We're looking for warmth, competence, and the kind of sensitivity that postpartum families deserve. If we wouldn't recommend them to someone we love, they're not in our network.</p>
