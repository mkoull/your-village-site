          <h2>The early weeks are harder than anyone prepared you for.</h2>
          <p>You're recovering from birth. You're learning to feed a baby who didn't read the manual. You haven't slept properly in days. And the person you most want to call lives hundreds of kilometres away.</p>
          <p>You know help exists somewhere — but finding it, vetting it, and coordinating it while you're running on empty? That's not something you should have to do alone.</p>

          <h2 class="mt-xl">We do what your mum would do if she lived around the corner.</h2>
          <p>Your coordinator learns your situation, works out what you need, and puts the right people around you. They introduce you to providers they personally trust, handle the scheduling, and check in every week to make sure things are working. If they're not, they adjust.</p>
          <p>You never have to explain your situation twice. You never have to chase a booking. You never have to wonder if you've chosen the right person.</p>
          <p><strong>We handle the coordination. You focus on your baby and yourself.</strong></p>
