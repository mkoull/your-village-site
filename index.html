            <h2>Why this exists.</h2>
            <p>I watched someone I love go through the first weeks with a newborn — no family nearby, no plan, and no idea where to start finding help. She's one of the most capable people I know, and none of that mattered. She was exhausted, overwhelmed, and trying to do something she'd never done before while recovering from something her body had never done before.</p>
            <p>The help was out there. But finding it, vetting it, coordinating it — all of that fell on the person with the least capacity to do it.</p>
            <p>Your Village is the thing I wished had existed for her. Not an app. Not a directory. A real person who already knows the providers, who listens to what you're going through, and who puts the right support in place so you don't have to figure it out alone.</p>
